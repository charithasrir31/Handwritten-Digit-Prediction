# Handwritten-Digit-Prediction
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset with a test accuracy of 99%. The model was built using TensorFlow and Keras, using the tensorflow.keras.datasets.mnist package to load and preprocess the data. 
This project demonstrates model training, evaluation, and performance visualization through confusion matrices and prediction plots.

## Features
**- Dataset:** MNIST dataset containing 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits at 28x28 pixels.

**- Model:** CNN architecture with Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, and Dense layers for digit classification.

**- Tools Used:** TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.

**- Results:** Achieved a test accuracy of 99% and generated comprehensive performance metrics including a confusion matrix and classification report.
